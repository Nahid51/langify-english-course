### `About Langify English Course`

This is an online and offline based English language and computer basic course where you can learn and develop your own skills. Also, you can know about us, our curriculum and our teachers. We have some best teachers to teach everyone properly.

### `How the Bookland Library was created`

First of all, the information of all the resources has been collected through Google search and some come from my mind. After collected data, I implemented all things into react app by using react-bootstrap and react-router. From UI the user can see our information easily and choose the course at their own will.

### `The purpose of making Langify`

The purpose of our course is to teach everyone about core English concepts and develop their reading, writing and speaking skills in English. Although we have computer basic course which develops some technical knowledge about computer.
